Microsoft has decided to expand into the cinamatic world by creating a new movie studio. To decide which kind of movies to make, they would like to find out which types are currently doing best at the box office. In the paragraphs below, we will look into what were the most popular genres in recent years to see if there are any trending genres as well as analyze to find out if run time effects how well a movie is rated. To also help Microsoft figure out just how much it would cost them to make a highly rated movie, we will analyze production budgets for the last five years. And finally, we will look into what types of profits Microsoft may be getting both domestically and globally if they were to make a highly rated movie.


###**Methodology**
The files used:
1. zippedData/tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
2. zippedData/imdb.title.ratings.csv.gz
3. zippedData/imdb.title.basics.csv.gz
4. zippedData/bom.movie_gross.csv.gz

###Ratings of Genres Throughout the Years

Sorting through the files above, it was possible to gather and analyze relevant data that would help Microsoft in choosing which movie would be the best to make. To see if there were any trending genres in particular that were reoccuringly successful, data from the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 was evaluated. The one genre that consitently rated high throughout these years was Drama. This is a positive indication that a movie made with a fusion including Drama would be a prosperous type of film since not only was it popular the last fifteen years, but it also was trending in the year 2019-2020. It should be metioned however, that in addition to Drama, Adventure did feature heavily as well in the past year.
